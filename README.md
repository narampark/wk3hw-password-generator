# Week 3 JavaScript Password Generator

## Description
This project was to take the given html, css, and javascript code to make a functioning password generator. With the base codes given I just had to add code to the javascript to get it working. The working password generator takes the parameters set by the user; with the length being between 8 to 128 characters and the character type choices being uppercase, lowercase, numbers, and special characters; and randomly generates a password according to the parameters. A validation message will pop up to display the chosen parameters and then a randomly generated password will be displayed on a column on the page.
